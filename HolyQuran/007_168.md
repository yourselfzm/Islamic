|    马坚    | 我曾使他们散处四方，成为若干派别，他们中有善人，有次于善人的，我用种种祸福考验他们，以便他们觉悟。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | We broke them up into sections on this earth. There are among them some that are the righteous, and some that are the opposite. We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity: In order that they might turn (to us). |
| PICKTHALL  | And We have sundered them in the earth as (separate) nations. Some of them are righteous, and some far from that. And We have tried them with good things and evil things that haply they might return. |
|   SHAKIR   | And We cut them up on the earth into parties, (some) of them being righteous and (others) of them falling short of that, and We tried them with blessings and misfortunes that they might turn. |
