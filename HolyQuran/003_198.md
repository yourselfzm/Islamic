#لَٰكِنِ الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا رَبَّهُمْ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا نُزُلًا مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ ۗ وَمَا عِنْدَ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِلْأَبْرَارِ 

##Lakini allatheena ittaqaw rabbahum lahum jannatun tajree min tahtiha al-anharu khalideena feeha nuzulan min AAindi Allahi wama AAinda Allahi khayrun lil-abrari

|    马坚    | 敬畏主的人，却得享受下临诸河的乐园，而永居其中。这是从真主那里发出的款待。在真主那里的恩典，对于义人是更有益的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | On the other hand, for those who fear their Lord, are Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath; therein are they to dwell (for ever),- a gift from the presence of Allah; and that which is in the presence of Allah is the best (bliss) for the righteous. |
| PICKTHALL  | But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will be safe for ever. A gift of welcome from their Lord. That which Allah hath in store is better for the righteous. |
|   SHAKIR   | But as to those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord, they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding in them; an entertainment from their Lord, and that which is with Allah is best for the righteous. |
