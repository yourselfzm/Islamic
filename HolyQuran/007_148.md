|    马坚    | 穆萨的宗族在他（离开）之后，以他们的首饰铸成一头牛犊——一个有犊声的躯壳。难道他们不知道它不能和他们对话，不能指引他们道路吗？他们以它为神灵，他们是不义者。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | The people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, the image of calf, (for worship): it seemed to low: did they not see that it could neither speak to them, nor show them the way? They took it for worship and they did wrong. |
| PICKTHALL  | And the folk of Moses, after (he left them), chose a calf (for worship), (made) out of their ornaments, of saffron hue, which gave a lowing sound. Saw they not that it spake not unto them nor guided them to any way? They chose it, and became wrong-doers. |
|   SHAKIR   | And Musa's people made of their ornaments a calf after him, a (mere) body, which gave a mooing sound. What! could they not see that it did not speak to them nor guide them m the way? They took it (for worship) and they were unjust. |
