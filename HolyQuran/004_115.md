|    马坚    | 谁在认清正道之后反对使者，而遵循非信士的道路，我将听谁自便，并使他入于火狱中，那是一个恶劣的归宿。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | If anyone contends with the Messenger even after guidance has been plainly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that becoming to men of Faith, We shall leave him in the path he has chosen, and land him in Hell,- what an evil refuge! |
| PICKTHALL  | And whoso opposeth the messenger after the guidance (of Allah) hath been manifested unto him, and followeth other than the believer's way, We appoint for him that unto which he himself hath turned, and expose him unto hell - a hapless journey's end! |
|   SHAKIR   | And whoever acts hostilely to the Apostle after that guidance has become manifest to him, and follows other than the way of the believers, We will turn him to that to which he has (himself) turned and make him enter hell; and it is an evil resort |
