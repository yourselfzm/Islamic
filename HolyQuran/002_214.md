|    马坚    | 你们还没有遭遇前人所遭遇的患难，就猜想自己得入乐园了吗？前人曾遭受穷困和患难，曾受震惊，甚至使者和信道的人都说：真主的援助甚麽时候降临呢？真的，真主的援助，确是临近的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Or do ye think that ye shall enter the Garden (of bliss) without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? they encountered suffering and adversity, and were so shaken in spirit that even the Messenger and those of faith who were with him cried: "When (will come) the help of Allah?" Ah! Verily, the help of Allah is (always) near! |
|  PICKTHAL  | Or think ye that ye will enter paradise while yet there hath not come unto you the like of (that which came to) those who passed away before you? Affliction and adversity befell them, they were shaken as with earthquake, till the messenger (of Allah) and those who believed along with him said: When cometh Allah's help? Now surely Allah's help is nigh. |
|   SHAKIR   | Or do you think that you would enter the garden while yet the state of those who have passed away before you has not come upon you; distress and affliction befell them and they were shaken violently, so that the Messenger and those who believed with him said: When will the help of Allah come? Now surely the help of Allah is nigh! |
