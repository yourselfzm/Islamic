|    马坚    | 当时，你的主宣布他一定派人来使他们继续遭受酷刑，直到复活日。你的主的惩罚确是神速的。他确是至赦的，确是至慈的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Behold! thy Lord did declare that He would send against them, to the Day of Judgment, those who would afflict them with grievous penalty. Thy Lord is quick in retribution, but He is also Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. |
| PICKTHALL  | And (remember) when thy Lord proclaimed that He would raise against them till the Day of Resurrection those who would lay on them a cruel torment. Lo! verily thy Lord is swift in prosecution and lo! verily He is Forgiving, Merciful. |
|   SHAKIR   | And when your Lord announced that He would certainly send against them to the day of resurrection those who would subject them to severe torment; most surely your Lord is quick to requite (evil) and most surely He is Forgiving, Merciful. |
