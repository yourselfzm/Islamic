|    马坚    | 他用欺骗的手段使他俩堕落。当他俩尝了那棵树的果实的时候，他俩的阴部便对自己现露出来了，他俩只好用园里的树叶遮盖自己的阴部。他俩的主喊叫他俩说：难道我没有禁止你俩吃那棵树的果实吗？难道我没有对你俩说过，恶魔确是你俩的明敌吗？ |
|  YUSUFALI  | So by deceit he brought about their fall: when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies. And their Lord called unto them: "Did I not forbid you that tree, and tell you that Satan was an avowed enemy unto you?" |
| PICKTHALL  | Thus did he lead them on with guile. And when they tasted of the tree their shame was manifest to them and they began to hide (by heaping) on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called them, (saying): Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you: Lo! Satan is an open enemy to you? |
|   SHAKIR   | Then he caused them to fall by deceit; so when they tasted of the tree, their evil inclinations became manifest to them, and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden; and their Lord called out to them: Did I not forbid you both from that tree and say to you that the Shaitan is your open enemy? |
