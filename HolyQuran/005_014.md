|    马坚    | 自称基督教徒的人，我曾与他们缔约，但他们抛弃自己所受的一部分劝戒，故我使他们互相仇恨，至于复活日。那时，真主要把他们的行为告诉他们。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | From those too who call themselves Christians We did take a Covenant but they forgot a good part of the Message that was sent them: so We estranged them with enmity and hatred between the one and the other to the Day of Judgment. And soon will Allah show them what it is they have done. |
| PICKTHALL  | And with those who say: "Lo! we are Christians," We made a covenant, but they forgot a part of that whereof they were admonished. Therefor We have stirred up enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will inform them of their handiwork. |
|   SHAKIR   | And with those who say, We are Christians, We made a covenant, but they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of, therefore We excited among them enmity and hatred to the day of resurrection; and Allah will inform them of what they did. |
