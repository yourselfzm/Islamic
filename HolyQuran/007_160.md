|    马坚    | 我把他们分为十二支派，即部落。当穆萨的宗族向他求水的时候，我启示他说：你用你的手杖打那磐石吧。十二股泉水就从那磐石里涌出来，各部落都知道自己的饮水处。我以白云荫蔽他们，又降下甘露和鹌鹑给他们。（我对他们说）：你们可以吃我所供给你们的佳美的食物。他们没有亏负我，但他们自亏了。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: "Strike the rock with thy staff": out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, (saying): "Eat of the good things We have provided for you": (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls. |
| PICKTHALL  | We divided them into twelve tribes, nations; and We inspired Moses, when his people asked him for water, saying: Smite with thy staff the rock! And there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs, so that each tribe knew their drinking-place. And we caused the white cloud to overshadow them and sent down for them the manna and the quails (saying): Eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you. They wronged Us not, but they were wont to wrong themselves. |
|   SHAKIR   | And We divided them into twelve tribes, as nations; and We revealed to Musa when his people asked him for water: Strike the rock with your staff, so outnowed from it twelve springs; each tribe knew its drinking place; and We made the clouds to give shade over them and We sent to them manna and quails: Eat of the good things We have given you. And they did not do Us any harm, but they did injustice to their own souls. |
