|    马坚    | 你们中的确有人逗留后方，如果你们遭遇灾难，他就说：真主确已护佑我，因为我没有同他们在前方。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | There are certainly among you men who would tarry behind: If a misfortune befalls you, they say: "Allah did favor us in that we were not present among them." |
| PICKTHALL  | Lo! among you there is he who loitereth; and if disaster overtook you, he would say: Allah hath been gracious unto me since I was not present with them. |
|   SHAKIR   | And surely among you is he who would certainly hang back! If then a misfortune befalls you he says: Surely Allah conferred a benefit on me that I was not present with them. |
