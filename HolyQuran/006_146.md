|    马坚    | 我只禁戒犹太教徒吃一切有爪的禽兽，又禁戒他们吃牛羊的脂油，惟牛羊脊上或肠上或骨间的脂油除外。这是我因为他们的不义而加于他们的惩罚，我确是诚实的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | For those who followed the Jewish Law We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their backs or their entrails or is mixed up with a bone: this in recompense for their wilful disobedience: for We are True (in Our ordinances). |
| PICKTHALL  | Unto those who are Jews We forbade every animal with claws. And of the oxen and the sheep forbade We unto them the fat thereof save that upon the backs or the entrails, or that which is mixed with the bone. That we awarded them for their rebellion. And lo! we verily are truthful. |
|   SHAKIR   | And to those who were Jews We made unlawful every animal having claws, and of oxen and sheep We made unlawful to them the fat of both, except such as was on their backs or the entrails or what was mixed with bones: this was a punishment We gave them on account of their rebellion, and We are surely Truthful. |
