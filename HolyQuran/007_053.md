|    马坚    | 他们只等待那部经典的效果，他的效果到来的日子，从前忘记这经典的人将会说：我们的主的众使者，确已昭示真理了！我们有几位说情的人来替我们说情，或准我们返回尘世去，舍罪恶而立善功吗？他们确已亏折了自身，他们所捏造的事已回避他们了。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Do they just wait for the final fulfilment of the event? On the day the event is finally fulfilled, those who disregarded it before will say: "The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring true (tidings). Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back? then should we behave differently from our behaviour in the past." In fact they will have lost their souls, and the things they invented will leave them in the lurch. |
| PICKTHALL  | Await they aught save the fulfilment thereof? On the day when the fulfilment thereof cometh, those who were before forgetful thereof will say: The messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth! Have we any intercessors, that they may intercede for us? Or can we be returned (to life on earth), that we may act otherwise than we used to act? They have lost their souls, and that which they devised hath failed them. |
|   SHAKIR   | Do they wait for aught but its final sequel? On the day when its final sequel comes about, those who neglected it before will say: Indeed the messengers of our Lord brought the truth; are there for us then any intercessors so that they should intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back so that we should do (deeds) other than those which we did? Indeed they have lost their souls and that which they forged has gone away from them. |
