#قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَصَائِرُ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۖ فَمَنْ أَبْصَرَ فَلِنَفْسِهِ ۖ وَمَنْ عَمِيَ فَعَلَيْهَا ۚ وَمَا أَنَا عَلَيْكُمْ بِحَفِيظٍ 

##Qad jaakum basairu min rabbikum faman absara falinafsihi waman AAamiya faAAalayha wama ana AAalaykum bihafeethin

|    马坚    | 从你们的主发出的许多明证，已降临你们；谁重视那些明证，谁自受其益；谁忽视那些明证，谁自受其害；我不是监护你们的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | "Now have come to you from your Lord proofs to open your eyes: if any will see it will be for (the good of) his own soul; if any will be blind it will be to his own (harm): I am not (here) to watch over your doings." |
| PICKTHALL  | Proofs have come unto you from your Lord, so whoso seeth, it is for his own good, and whoso is blind is blind to his own hurt. And I am not a keeper over you. |
|   SHAKIR   | Indeed there have come to you clear proofs from your Lord; whoever will therefore see, it is for his own soul and whoever will be blind, it shall be against himself and I am not a keeper over you. |
