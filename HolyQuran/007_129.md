|    马坚    | 他们说：你到来之前，我们受虐待，你到来之后，我们仍然受虐待！他说：你们的主，或许会毁灭你们的仇敌，而以你们为这地方的代治者，看看你们是怎样工作的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | They said: "We have had (nothing but) trouble, both before and after thou camest to us." He said: "It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritors in the earth; that so He may try you by your deeds." |
| PICKTHALL  | They said: We suffered hurt before thou camest unto us, and since thou hast come unto us. He said: It may be that your Lord is going to destroy your adversary and make you viceroys in the earth, that He may see how ye behave. |
|   SHAKIR   | They said: We have been persecuted before you came to us and since you have come to us. He said: It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land, then He will see how you act. |
