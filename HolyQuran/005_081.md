|    马坚    | 假若他们确信真主和先知，以及降示他的经典，他们必定不以不信道的人为盟友，但他们多数是犯罪的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | If only they had believed in Allah in the Apostle and in what hath been revealed to him never would they have taken them for friends and protectors but most of them are rebellious wrong-doers. |
| PICKTHALL  | If they believed in Allah and the Prophet and that which is revealed unto him, they would not choose them for their friends. But many of them are of evil conduct. |
|   SHAKIR   | And had they believed in Allah and the prophet and what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them for friends but! most of them are transgressors. |
