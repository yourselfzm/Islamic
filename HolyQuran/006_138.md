|    马坚    | 他们妄言：这些是禁牲和禁谷，只有我们所意欲的人才可以吃；这些牲畜，是不准人骑的；这些牲畜，是不诵真主之名而宰的。他们假借真主的名义而造谣，他要为他们造谣而报酬他们。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | And they say that such and such cattle and crops are taboo and none should eat of them except those whom so they say We wish; further there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden and cattle on which (at slaughter) the name of Allah is not pronounced; inventions against Allah's name: soon will He requite them for their inventions. |
| PICKTHALL  | And they say: Such cattle and crops are forbidden. No-one is to eat of them save whom we will - in their make-believe - cattle whose backs are forbidden, cattle over which they mention not the name of Allah. (All that is) a lie against Him. He will repay them for that which they invent. |
|   SHAKIR   | And they say: These are cattle and tilth prohibited, none shall eat them except such as We please-- so they assert-- and cattle whose backs are forbidden, and cattle on which they would not mention Allah's name-- forging a lie against Him; He shall requite them for what they forged. |
