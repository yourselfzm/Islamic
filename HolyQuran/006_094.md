|    马坚    | 你们确已孤孤单单地来见我，犹如我初次创造你们的时候一样。你们把我所赏赐你们的，抛弃在背后，你们妄称为真主的伙伴的，我不见他们同你们一道来替你们说情；你们的关系，确已断绝；你们所妄言的事，确已回避你们了。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | "And behold! ye come to Us bare and alone as We created you for the first time: Ye have left behind you all (the favors) which We bestowed on you: We see not with you your intercessors whom ye thought to be partners in your affairs: so now all relations between you have been cut off and your (pet) fancies have left you in the lurch!" |
| PICKTHALL  | Now have ye come unto Us solitary as We did create you at the first, and ye have left behind you all that We bestowed upon you, and We behold not with you those your intercessors, of whom ye claimed that they possessed a share in you. Now is the bond between you severed, and that which ye presumed hath failed you. |
|   SHAKIR   | And certainly you have come to Us alone as We created you at first, and you have left behind your backs the things which We gave you, and We do not see with you your intercessors about whom you asserted that they were (Allah's) associates in respect to you; certainly the ties between you are now cut off and what you asserted is gone from you. |
