| 马坚       | 假若他们信道，而且敬畏，那末，从真主那里降下的报酬，必是更好的；假若他们知道，（必已信道）。 |
| YUSUFALI   | If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil, far better had been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew! |
| PICKTHAL   | And if they had believed and kept from evil, a recompense from Allah would be better, if they only knew. |
| SHAKIR     | And if they had believed and guarded themselves (against evil), reward from Allah would certainly have been better; had they but known (this). |
