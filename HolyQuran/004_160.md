|    马坚    | 我禁止犹太教徒享受原来准许他们享受的许多佳美的食物， 因为他们多行不义，常常阻止人遵循主道， |
|  YUSUFALI  | For the iniquity of the Jews We made unlawful for them certain (foods) good and wholesome which had been lawful for them;- in that they hindered many from Allah's Way;- |
| PICKTHALL  | Because of the wrongdoing of the Jews We forbade them good things which were (before) made lawful unto them, and because of their much hindering from Allah's way, |
|   SHAKIR   | Wherefore for the iniquity of those who are Jews did We disallow to them the good things which had been made lawful for them and for their hindering many (people) from Allah's way. |
