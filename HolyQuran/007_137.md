|    马坚    | 我使被欺负的民众，继承了我曾降福其中的土地的四境。以色列的后裔，能忍受虐待，故你的主对他们的最佳诺言已完全实现了；我毁灭了法老和他的百姓所构造的，和他们所建筑的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | And We made a people, considered weak (and of no account), inheritors of lands in both east and west, - lands whereon We sent down Our blessings. The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because they had patience and constancy, and We levelled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected (with such pride). |
| PICKTHALL  | And We caused the folk who were despised to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We had blessed. And the fair word of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of their endurance; and We annihilated (all) that Pharaoh and his folk had done and that they had contrived. |
|   SHAKIR   | And We made the people who were deemed weak to mhent the eastern lands and the western ones which We had blessed; and the good word of your Lord was fulfilled in the children of Israel because they bore up (sufferings) patiently; and We utterly destroyed what Firon and his people had wrought and what they built. |
