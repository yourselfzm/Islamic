|    马坚    | 也要认识伪信的人。有人对他们说：你们来吧，来为主道而作战，或来自卫吧！他们说：假若我们会打仗，我们必定追随你们。在那日，与其说他们是信道的人，不如说他们是不信道的人。他们口里所说的，并不是他们心里所想的。真主是知道他们所隐讳者的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | And the Hypocrites also. These were told: "Come, fight in the way of Allah, or (at least) drive (The foe from your city)." They said: "Had we known how to fight, we should certainly have followed you." They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal. |
| PICKTHALL  | And that He might know the hypocrites, unto whom it was said: Come, fight in the way of Allah, or defend yourselves. They answered: If we knew aught of fighting we would follow you. On that day they were nearer disbelief than faith. They utter with their mouths a thing which is not in their hearts. Allah is Best Aware of what they hide. |
|   SHAKIR   | And that He might know the hypocrites; and it was said to them: Come, fight in Allah's way, or defend yourselves. They said: If we knew fighting, we would certainly have followed you. They were on that day much nearer to unbelief than to belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, and Allah best knows what they conceal. |
