|    马坚    | 犹太教徒中有一群人篡改经文，他们说：我们听而不从，愿你听而不闻，拉仪那，这是因为巧方谩骂，诽谤正教。假若他们说：我们既听且从，你听吧，温助尔那，这对他们是更好的，是更正的。但真主因他们不信道而弃绝他们，故他们除少数人外都不信道。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their (right) places, and say: "We hear and we disobey"; and "Hear, may you not hear"; and "Rā’inā"; with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: "We hear and we obey"; and "Do hear"; and "Do look at us"; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe. |
| PICKTHALL  | Some of those who are Jews change words from their context and say: "We hear and disobey; hear thou as one who heareth not" and "Listen to us!" distorting with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said: "We hear and we obey: hear thou, and look at us" it had been better for them, and more upright. But Allah hath cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, save a few. |
|   SHAKIR   | Of those who are Jews (there are those who) alter words from their places and say: We have heard and we disobey and: Hear, may you not be made to hear! and: Raina, distorting (the word) with their tongues and taunting about religion; and if they had said (instead): We have heard and we obey, and hearken, and unzurna it would have been better for them and more upright; but Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief, so they do not believe but a little. |
