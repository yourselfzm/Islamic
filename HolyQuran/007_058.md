# وَالْبَلَدُ الطَّيِّبُ يَخْرُجُ نَبَاتُهُ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِ ۖ وَالَّذِي خَبُثَ لَا يَخْرُجُ إِلَّا نَكِدًا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ نُصَرِّفُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَشْكُرُونَ 

##Waalbaladu alttayyibu yakhruju nabatuhu bi-ithni rabbihi waallathee khabutha la yakhruju illa nakidan kathalika nusarrifu al-ayati liqawmin yashkuroona

|    马坚    | 肥沃的地方的植物，奉真主的命令而生长，瘠薄的地方的植物，出得很少，我这样为感激的民众阐述一切迹象。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | From the land that is clean and good, by the will of its Cherisher, springs up produce, (rich) after its kind: but from the land that is bad, springs up nothing but that which is niggardly: thus do we explain the signs by various (symbols) to those who are grateful. |
| PICKTHALL  | As for the good land, its vegetation cometh forth by permission of its Lord; while as for that which is bad, only the useless cometh forth (from it). Thus do We recount the tokens for people who give thanks. |
|   SHAKIR   | And as for the good land, its vegetation springs forth (abundantly) by the permission of its Lord, and (as for) that which is inferior (its herbage) comes forth but scantily; thus do We repeat the communications for a people who give thanks. |
