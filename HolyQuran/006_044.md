|    马坚    | 当他们忘却自己所受的劝告的时候，我为他们开辟一切福利之门，直到他们因自己所受的赏赐而狂喜的时候，我忽然惩治他们，而他们立刻变成沮丧的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | But when they forget the warning they had received We opened to them the gates of all (good) things until in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts on a sudden We called them to account when lo! they were plunged in despair! |
| PICKTHALL  | Then, when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded, We opened unto them the gates of all things till, even as they were rejoicing in that which they were given, We seized them unawares, and lo! they were dumbfounded. |
|   SHAKIR   | But when they neglected that with which they had been admonished, We opened for them the doors of all things, until when they rejoiced in what they were given We seized them suddenly; then lo! they were in utter despair. |
