|    马坚    | 你向他们询问那个滨海城市的情况吧。当时他们在安息日违法乱纪。当时，每逢他们守安息日的时候，鱼儿就浮游到他们面前来；每逢他们不守安息日的时候，鱼儿就不到他们的面前来。由于他们不义的行为，我才这样考验他们。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them, openly holding up their heads, but on the day they had no Sabbath, they came not: thus did We make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression. |
| PICKTHALL  | Ask them (O Muhammad) of the township that was by the sea, how they did break the Sabbath, how their big fish came unto them visibly upon their Sabbath day and on a day when they did not keep Sabbath came they not unto them. Thus did We try them for that they were evil-livers. |
|   SHAKIR   | And ask them about the town which stood by the sea; when they exceeded the limits of the Sabbath, when their fish came to them on the day of their Sabbath, appearing on the surface of the water, and on the day on which they did not keep the Sabbath they did not come to them; thus did We try them because they transgressed. |
