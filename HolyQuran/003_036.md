|    马坚    | 当她生了一个女孩的时候，她说：我确已生了一个女孩。真主是知道她所生的孩子的。男孩不象女孩一样。我确已把她叫做麦尔彦，求你保佑她和她的后裔，免受被弃绝的恶魔的搔扰。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | When she was delivered, she said: "O my Lord! Behold! I am delivered of a female child!"- and Allah knew best what she brought forth- "And no wise is the male Like the female. I have named her Mary, and I commend her and her offspring to Thy protection from the Evil One, the Rejected." |
| PICKTHALL  | And when she was delivered she said: My Lord! Lo! I am delivered of a female - Allah knew best of what she was delivered - the male is not as the female; and lo! I have named her Mary, and lo! I crave Thy protection for her and for her offspring from Satan the outcast. |
|   SHAKIR   | So when she brought forth, she said: My Lord! Surely I have brought it forth a female-- and Allah knew best what she brought forth-- and the male is not like the female, and I have named it Marium, and I commend her and her offspring into Thy protection from the accursed Shaitan. |
