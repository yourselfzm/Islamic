|    马坚    | 在自欺的情状之下众天神使其死亡的人，众天神必定问他们说：生前你们是在什么情状之下呢！他们说：我们在地方上被人欺负的。他们问：难道真主的大地不是宽阔的、能容你们迁移的吗？这等人的归宿是火狱，那是一个恶劣的归宿。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls, they say: "In what (plight) were ye?" They reply: "Weak and oppressed were we in the earth." They say: "Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to move yourselves away (from evil)?" Such men will find their abode in Hell,- What an evil refuge! - |
| PICKTHALL  | Lo! as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they wrong themselves, (the angels) will ask: In what were ye engaged ? They will say: We were oppressed in the land. (The angels) will say: Was not Allah's earth spacious that ye could have migrated therein ? As for such, their habitation will be hell, an evil journey's end; |
|   SHAKIR   | Surely (as for) those whom the angels cause to die while they are unjust to their souls, they shall say: In what state were you? They shall say: We were weak in the earth. They shall say: Was not Allah's earth spacious, so that you should have migrated therein? So these it is whose abode is hell, and it is an evil resort |
