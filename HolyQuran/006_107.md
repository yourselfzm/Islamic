|    马坚    | 假若真主意欲，他们必不以物配主。我没有以你为他们的保护者，你也绝不是他们的监护者。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | If it had been Allah's Plan they would not have taken false gods: but We made thee not one to watch over their doings nor art thou set over them to dispose of their affairs. |
| PICKTHALL  | Had Allah willed, they had not been idolatrous. We have not set thee as a keeper over them, nor art thou responsible for them. |
|   SHAKIR   | And if Allah had pleased, they would not have set up others (with Him) and We have not appointed you a keeper over them, and you are not placed in charge of them. |
