|    马坚    | 当他们不采纳忠告的时候，我拯救了戒人作恶者，而以严刑惩罚不义者，因为他们犯了罪。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, We rescued those who forbade Evil; but We visited the wrong-doers with a grievous punishment because they were given to transgression. |
| PICKTHALL  | And when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded, We rescued those who forbade wrong, and visited those who did wrong with dreadful punishment because they were evil-livers. |
