|    马坚    | 曾以宗教为娱乐和嬉戏，而且为尘世所欺骗者，我今天忘记他们，因为他们曾忘记有今日之相遇，还因为他们否认我的迹象。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | "Such as took their religion to be mere amusement and play, and were deceived by the life of the world." That day shall We forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, and as they were wont to reject Our signs. |
| PICKTHALL  | Who took their religion for a sport and pastime, and whom the life of the world beguiled. So this day We have forgotten them even as they forgot the meeting of this their Day and as they used to deny Our tokens. |
|   SHAKIR   | Who take their religion for an idle sport and a play and this life's world deceives them; so today We forsake them, as they neglected the meeting of this day of theirs and as they denied Our communications. |
