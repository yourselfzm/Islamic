#وَرَبُّكَ الْغَنِيُّ ذُو الرَّحْمَةِ ۚ إِنْ يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفْ مِنْ بَعْدِكُمْ مَا يَشَاءُ كَمَا أَنْشَأَكُمْ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّةِ قَوْمٍ آخَرِينَ

|    马坚    | 你的主是自足的，是仁慈的。如果他意欲，他就使你们消逝，而以他所意欲的人继承你们，犹如从别的民族的后裔中使你们兴起一样。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Thy Lord is Self-sufficient full of Mercy: if it were His Will He could destroy you and in your place appoint whom He will as your successors even as he raised you up from the posterity of other people. |
| PICKTHALL  | Thy Lord is the Absolute, the Lord of Mercy. If He will, He can remove you and can cause what He will to follow after you, even as He raised you from the seed of other folk. |
|   SHAKIR   | And your Lord is the Self-sufficient one, the Lord of mercy; if He pleases, He may take you off, and make whom He pleases successors after you, even as He raised you up from the seed of another people. |
