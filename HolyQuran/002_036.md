|    马坚    | 然後，恶魔使他们俩为那棵树而犯罪，遂将他们俩人从所居的乐园中诱出。我说：你们互相仇视下去吧。大地上有你们暂时的住处和享受。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: "Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time." |
| PICKTHALL  | But Satan caused them to deflect therefrom and expelled them from the (happy) state in which they were; and We said: Fall down, one of you a foe unto the other! There shall be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a time. |
|   SHAKIR   | But the Shaitan made them both fall from it, and caused them to depart from that (state) in which they were; and We said: Get forth, some of you being the enemies of others, and there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time. |
