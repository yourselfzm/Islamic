#وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ وُقِفُوا عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُوا يَا لَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلَا نُكَذِّبَ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ 

##Walaw tara ith wuqifoo AAala alnnari faqaloo ya laytana nuraddu wala nukaththiba biayati rabbina wanakoona mina almumineena

|    马坚    | 当他们奉命站在火狱边上的时候，假若你看到他们的情状。于是，他们说：啊！但愿我们得复返人世，我们不再否认我们的主的迹象，而我们要做信士了。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with the fire! They will say: "Would that we were but sent back! then would we not reject the Signs of our Lord but would be amongst those who believe! |
| PICKTHALL  | If thou couldst see when they are set before the Fire and say: Oh, would that we might return! Then would we not deny the revelations of our Lord but we would be of the believers! |
|   SHAKIR   | And could you see when they are made to stand before the fire, then they shall say: Would that we were sent back, and we would not reject the communications of our Lord and we would be of the believers. |
