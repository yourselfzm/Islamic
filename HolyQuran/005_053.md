|    马坚    | 信道的人说：这等人，就是指真主而发出最严重的盟誓，自称与你们同教的人吗？他们的善功，已完全无效，故他们已变成亏折的人。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | And those who believe will say: "Are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by Allah that they were with you?" All that they do will be in vain and they will fall into (nothing but) ruin. |
| PICKTHALL  | Then will the believers say (unto the people of the Scripture): are these they who swore by Allah their most binding oaths that they were surely with you ? Their works have failed, and they have become the losers. |
|   SHAKIR   | And those who believe will say: Are these they who swore by Allah with the most forcible of their oaths that they were most surely with you? Their deeds shall go for nothing, so they shall become losers. |
