|    马坚    | 不然，他们以前所隐讳的，已经为他们而暴露出来。即使他们得复返人世，他们仍必再犯他们以前所被禁戒的事。他们确是说谎的人。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Yea in their own (eyes) will become manifest what before they concealed but if they were returned they would certainly relapse to the things they were forbidden for they are indeed liars. |
| PICKTHALL  | Nay, but that hath become clear unto them which before they used to hide. And if they were sent back they would return unto that which they are forbidden. Lo! they are liars. |
|   SHAKIR   | Nay, what they concealed before shall become manifest to them; and if they were sent back, they would certainly go back to that which they are forbidden, and most surely they are liars. |
