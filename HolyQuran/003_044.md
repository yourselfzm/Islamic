|    马坚    | 这是关于幽玄的消息，我把它启示你；当他们用拈阄法决定谁抚养麦尔彦的时候，你没有在场，他们争论的时候，你也没有在场。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | This is part of the tidings of the things unseen, which We reveal unto thee (O Messenger!) by inspiration: Thou wast not with them when they cast lots with arrows, as to which of them should be charged with the care of Mary: Nor wast thou with them when they disputed (the point). |
|  PICKTHAL  | This is of the tidings of things hidden. We reveal it unto thee (Muhammad). Thou wast not present with them when they threw their pens (to know) which of them should be the guardian of Mary, nor wast thou present with them when they quarrelled (thereupon). |
|   SHAKIR   | This is of the announcements relating to the unseen which We reveal to you; and you were not with them when they cast their pens (to decide) which of them should have Marium in his charge, and you were not with them when they contended one with another. |
