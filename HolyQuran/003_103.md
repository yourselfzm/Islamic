|    马坚    | 你们当全体坚持真主的绳索，不要自己分裂。你们当铭记真主所赐你们的恩典，当时，你们原是仇敌，而真主联合你们的心，你们借他的恩典才变成教胞；你们原是在一个火坑的边缘上的，是真主使你们脱离那个火坑。真主如此为你们阐明他的迹象，以便你们遵循正道。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | And hold fast, all together, by the rope which Allah (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude Allah's favour on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you: That ye may be guided. |
| PICKTHALL  | And hold fast, all of you together, to the cable of Allah, and do not separate. And remember Allah's favour unto you: How ye were enemies and He made friendship between your hearts so that ye became as brothers by His grace; and (how) ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire, and He did save you from it. Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations unto you, that haply ye may be guided, |
|   SHAKIR   | And hold fast by the covenant of Allah all together and be not disunited, and remember the favor of Allah on you when you were enemies, then He united your hearts so by His favor you became brethren; and you were on the brink of a pit of fire, then He saved you from it, thus does Allah make clear to you His communications that you may follow the right way. |
