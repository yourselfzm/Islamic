|    马坚    | 我为男女所遗产每一份财产而规定继承人，即父母和至亲，以及你们曾与她们缔结婚约的人，你们应当把这些继承人的应继份额交给他们。真主确是见证万物的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | To (benefit) every one, We have appointed shares and heirs to property left by parents and relatives. To those, also, to whom your right hand was pledged, give their due portion. For truly Allah is witness to all things. |
| PICKTHALL  | And unto each We have appointed heirs of that which parents and near kindred leave; and as for those with whom your right hands have made a covenant, give them their due. Lo! Allah is ever Witness over all things. |
|   SHAKIR   | And to every one We have appointed heirs of what parents and near relatives leave; and as to those with whom your rights hands have ratified agreements, give them their portion; surely Allah is a witness over all things. |
