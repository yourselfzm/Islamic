|    马坚    | 以物配主者的配主，这样诱惑他们中的许多人杀害自己的儿女，以便毁灭他们，并混乱他们的宗教。假若真主意欲，那末，他们就不做这件事，故你当任他们伪造谎言。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Even so in the eyes of most of the Pagans their 'partners' made alluring the slaughter of their children in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. If Allah had willed they would not have done so: but leave alone them and their inventions. |
| PICKTHALL  | Thus have their (so-called) partners (of Allah) made the killing of their children to seem fair unto many of the idolaters, that they may ruin them and make their faith obscure for them. Had Allah willed (it otherwise), they had not done so. So leave them alone with their devices. |
|   SHAKIR   | And thus their associates have made fair seeming to most of the polytheists the killing of their children, that they may cause them to perish and obscure for them their religion; and if Allah had pleased, they would not have done it, therefore leave them and that which they forge. |
