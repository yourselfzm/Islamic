|    马坚    | 当我的刑罚降临他们的时候，他们唯一的辩诉是说：我们原来确是不义的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | When (thus) Our punishment took them, no cry did they utter but this: "Indeed we did wrong." |
| PICKTHALL  | No plea had they, when Our terror came unto them, save that they said: Lo! We were wrong-doers. |
|   SHAKIR   | Yet their cry, when Our punishment came to them, was nothing but that they said: Surely we were unjust. |
