| 马坚       | 当时，穆萨对他的宗族说：我的宗族啊！你们确因认犊为神而自欺，故你们当向造物主悔罪，当处死罪人。在真主看来，这对於你们确是更好的。他就恕宥你们。他确是至宥的，确是至慈的。 |
| YUSUFALI   | And remember Moses said to his people: "O my people! Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance) to your Maker, and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker." Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness): For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. |
| PICKTHAL   | And when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Ye have wronged yourselves by your choosing of the calf (for worship) so turn in penitence to your Creator, and kill (the guilty) yourselves. That will be best for you with your Creator and He will relent toward you. Lo! He is the Relenting, the Merciful. |
| SHAKIR     | And when Musa said to his people: O my people! you have surely been unjust to yourselves by taking the calf (for a god), therefore turn to your Creator (penitently), so kill your people, that is best for you with your Creator: so He turned to you (mercifully), for surely He is the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful. |
