|    马坚    | 当我的惩罚降临的时候，他们为什么不谦逊呢？但他们的心坚硬，恶魔以他们的行为迷惑他们。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | When the suffering reached them from Us why then did they not learn humility? On the contrary their hearts became hardened and Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them. |
| PICKTHALL  | If only, when Our disaster came on them, they had been humble! But their hearts were hardened and the devil made all that they used to do seem fair unto them! |
|   SHAKIR   | Yet why did they not, when Our punishment came to them, humble themselves? But their hearts hardened and the Shaitan made what they did fair-seeming to them. |
