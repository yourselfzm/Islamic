|    马坚    | 你说：假若我能主持你们要求早日实现的刑罚，那末，我与你们之间的事情，必定被判决了。真主是最了解不义者的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Say: "If what ye would see hastened were in my power the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But Allah knoweth best those who do wrong." |
| PICKTHALL  | Say: If I had that for which ye are impatient, then would the case (ere this) have been decided between me and you. Allah is Best Aware of the wrong-doers. |
|   SHAKIR   | Say: If that which you desire to hasten were with me, the matter would have certainly been decided between you and me; and Allah best knows the unjust. |
