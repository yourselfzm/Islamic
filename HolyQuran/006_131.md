|    马坚    | 这是因为你的主在城市的居民昏聩之际，不会因为他们的不义而毁灭城市。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | (The apostles were sent) thus for thy Lord would not destroy for their wrong-doing men's habitations whilst their occupants were unwarned. |
| PICKTHALL  | This is because thy Lord destroyeth not the townships arbitrarily while their people are unconscious (of the wrong they do). |
|   SHAKIR   | This is because your Lord would not destroy towns unjustly while their people were negligent. |
