|    马坚    | 当时，真主与曾受天经的人缔约，说：你们必为世人阐明天经，你们不可隐讳它。但他们把它抛在背后，并以它换取些微的代价。他们所换取的真恶劣！ |
|  YUSUFALI  | And remember Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book, to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made! |
| PICKTHALL  | And (remember) when Allah laid a charge on those who had received the Scripture (He said): Ye are to expound it to mankind and not to hide it. But they flung it behind their backs and bought thereby a little gain. Verily evil is that which they have gained thereby. |
|   SHAKIR   | And when Allah made a covenant with those who were given the Book: You shall certainly make it known to men and you shall not hide it; but they cast it behind their backs and took a small price for it; so evil is that which they buy. |
