|    马坚    | 你们的妻子，在你们未与她们交接，也未为她们决定聘仪的期间，如果你们休了她们，那对於你们是毫无罪过的，但须以离仪赠与她们；离仪的厚薄，当斟酌丈夫的贫富，依例而赠与；这是善人所应尽的义务。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before consummation or the fixation of their dower; but bestow on them (A suitable gift), the wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his means;- A gift of a reasonable amount is due from those who wish to do the right thing. |
|  PICKTHAL  | It is no sin for you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched them, nor appointed unto them a portion. Provide for them, the rich according to his means, and the straitened according to his means, a fair provision. (This is) a bounden duty for those who do good. |
|   SHAKIR   | There is no blame on you if you divorce women when you have not touched them or appointed for them a portion, and make provision for them, the wealthy according to his means and the straitened in circumstances according to his means, a provision according to usage; (this is) a duty on the doers of good (to others). |
