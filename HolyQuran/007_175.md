|    马坚    | 你应当对他们宣读那个人的故事；我曾把我的许多迹象赏赐他，但他鄙弃那些迹象，故恶魔赶上他，而他变成了迷误者。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Relate to them the story of the man to whom We sent Our signs, but he passed them by: so Satan followed him up, and he went astray. |
| PICKTHALL  | Recite unto them the tale of him to whom We gave Our revelations, but he sloughed them off, so Satan overtook him and he became of those who lead astray. |
|   SHAKIR   | And recite to them the narrative of him to whom We give Our communications, but he withdraws himself from them, so the Shaitan overtakes him, so he is of those who go astray. |
