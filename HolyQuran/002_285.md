|    马坚    | 使者确信主所降示他的经典，信士们也确信那部经典，他们人人都确信真主和他的众天神，一切经典和众使者。（他们说）：我们对於他的任何使者，都不加以歧视。他们说：我们听从了，我们恳求你赦宥；我们的主啊！你是最後的归宿。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | The Messenger believeth in what hath been revealed to him from his Lord, as do the men of faith. Each one (of them) believeth in Allah, His angels, His books, and His messengers. "We make no distinction (they say) between one and another of His messengers." And they say: "We hear, and we obey: (We seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord, and to Thee is the end of all journeys." |
| PICKTHALL  | The messenger believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him from his Lord and (so do) believers. Each one believeth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and His messengers - We make no distinction between any of His messengers - and they say: We hear, and we obey. (Grant us) Thy forgiveness, our Lord. Unto Thee is the journeying. |
|   SHAKIR   | The messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers; they all believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers; We make no difference between any of His messengers; and they say: We hear and obey, our Lord! Thy forgiveness (do we crave), and to Thee is the eventual course. |
