| 马坚       | 当时，我与你们缔约，并将山岳树立在你们的上面，我说：你们当坚守我所赐你们的经典，并当听从。他们说：我们听而不从。他们不信道，故对犊之爱，已浸润了他们的心灵。你说：如果你们是信士，那末，你们的信仰所命你们的真恶劣！ |
| YUSUFALI   | And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): "Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken (to the Law)": They said:" We hear, and we disobey:" And they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the calf because of their Faithlessness. Say: "Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith!" |
| PICKTHAL   | And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear (Our Word), they said: We hear and we rebel. And (worship of) the calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection (of the covenant). Say (unto them): Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you, if ye are believers. |
| SHAKIR     | And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient. They said: We hear and disobey. And they were made to imbibe (the love of) the calf into their hearts on account of their unbelief Say: Evil is that which your belief bids you if you are believers. |
