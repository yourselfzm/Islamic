|    马坚    | 假若我降下一个天神，我必使他变成一个人样，我必使他们陷于自己所作的蒙蔽之中。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | If We had made it an angel We should have sent him as a man and We should certainly have caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion. |
| PICKTHALL  | Had we appointed him (Our messenger) an angel, We assuredly had made him (as) a man (that he might speak to men); and (thus) obscured for them (the truth) they (now) obscure. |
|   SHAKIR   | And if We had made him angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and We would certainly have made confused to them what they make confused. |
