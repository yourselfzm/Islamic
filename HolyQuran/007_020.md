|    马坚    | 但恶魔教唆他俩，以致为他俩显出他俩的被遮盖的阴部。他说：你俩的主禁你们俩吃这棵树的果实，只为不愿你俩变成天神，或永生不灭。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Then began Satan to whisper suggestions to them, bringing openly before their minds all their shame that was hidden from them (before): he said: "Your Lord only forbade you this tree, lest ye should become angels or such beings as live for ever." |
| PICKTHALL  | Then Satan whispered to them that he might manifest unto them that which was hidden from them of their shame, and he said: Your Lord forbade you from this tree only lest ye should become angels or become of the immortals. |
|   SHAKIR   | But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to them that he might make manifest to them what had been hidden from them of their evil inclinations, and he said: Your Lord has not forbidden you this tree except that you may not both become two angels or that you may (not) become of the immortals. |
