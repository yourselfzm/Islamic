|    马坚    | 分离自己的宗教而各成宗派的人，你与他们毫无关系；他们的事，只归真主。然后，他将把他们的行为告诉他们。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects thou hast no part in them in the least: their affair is with Allah: He will in the end tell them the truth of all that they did. |
| PICKTHALL  | Lo! As for those who sunder their religion and become schismatics, no concern at all hast thou with them. Their case will go to Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do. |
|   SHAKIR   | Surely they who divided their religion into parts and became sects, you have no concern with them; their affair is only with Allah, then He will inform them of what they did. |
