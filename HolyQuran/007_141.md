|    马坚    | 当时，我使你们脱离法老的臣民，他们使你们遭受酷刑，屠杀你们的儿子，保全你们的女子。此中有从你们的主降下的大难。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with the worst of penalties, who slew your male children and saved alive your females: in that was a momentous trial from your Lord. |
| PICKTHALL  | And (remember) when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. That was a tremendous trial from your Lord. |
|   SHAKIR   | And when We delivered you from Firon's people who subjected you to severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and in this there was a great trial from your Lord. |
