|    马坚    | 我将拔除他们心中的怨恨，他们将住在下临诸河的乐园，他们将说：一切赞颂，全归真主！他引导我们获此善报，假如真主没有引导我们，我们不致于遵循正道。我们的主的众使者，确已昭示了真理。或者将大声地对他们说：这就是你们因自己的行为而得继承的乐园。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury;- beneath them will be rivers flowing;- and they shall say: "Praise be to Allah, who hath guided us to this (felicity): never could we have found guidance, had it not been for the guidance of Allah: indeed it was the truth, that the messengers of our Lord brought unto us." And they shall hear the cry: "Behold! the garden before you! Ye have been made its inheritors, for your deeds (of righteousness)." |
| PICKTHALL  | And We remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts. Rivers flow beneath them. And they say: The praise to Allah, Who hath guided us to this. We could not truly have been led aright if Allah had not guided us. Verily the messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth. And it is cried unto them: This is the Garden. Ye inherit it for what ye used to do. |
|   SHAKIR   | And We will remove whatever of ill-feeling is in their breasts; the rivers shall flow beneath them and they shall say: All praise is due to Allah Who guided us to this, and we would not have found the way had it not been that Allah had guided us; certainly the messengers of our Lord brought the truth; and it shall be cried out to them that this is the garden of which you are made heirs for what you did. |
