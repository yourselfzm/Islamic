|    马坚    | 他们猜想没有祸害，故他们变成瞎的、聋的。嗣后，真主赦宥了他们。嗣后，他们中许多人又变成了瞎的、聋的。真主是明察他们的行为的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | They thought there would be no trial (or punishment); so they became blind and deaf: yet Allah (in mercy) turned to them: yet again many of them became blind and deaf. But Allah sees well all that they do. |
| PICKTHALL  | They thought no harm would come of it, so they were wilfully blind and deaf. And afterward Allah turned (in mercy) toward them. Now (even after that) are many of them wilfully blind and deaf. Allah is Seer of what they do. |
|   SHAKIR   | And they thought that there would be no affliction, so they became blind and deaf; then Allah turned to them mercifully, but many of them became blind and deaf; and Allah is well seeing what they do. |
