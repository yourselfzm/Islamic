|    马坚    | 这些城市，我已把它们的部分故事告诉了你。各民族的使者，确已用许多明证昭示本族的人；但他们不会相信自己以前所否认的。真主就这样封闭不信道者的心。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Such were the towns whose story We (thus) relate unto thee: There came indeed to them their messengers with clear (signs): But they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus doth Allah seal up the hearts of those who reject faith. |
| PICKTHALL  | Such were the townships. We relate some tidings of them unto thee (Muhammad). Their messengers verily came unto them with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty), but they could not believe because they had before denied. Thus doth Allah print upon the hearts of disbelievers (that they hear not). |
|   SHAKIR   | These towns-- We relate to you some of their stories, and certainly their messengers came to them with clear arguments, but they would not believe in what they rejected at first; thus does Allah set a seal over the hearts of the unbelievers |
