| 马坚       | 那是已逝去的民族，他们得享受他们的行为的报酬，你们也得享受你们的行为的报酬，你们对他们的行为不负责任。 |
| YUSUFALI   | That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case: |
| PICKTHAL   | Those are a people who have passed away; theirs is that which they earned and yours that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do. |
| SHAKIR     | This is a people that have passed away; they shall have what they earned and you shall have what you earn, and you shall not be called upon to answer for what they did. |
