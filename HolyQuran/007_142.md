|    马坚    | 我与穆萨约期三十夜。我又以十夜补足之，故他的主的约期共计四十夜。穆萨对他哥哥哈伦说：请你替我统率我的宗族。你要改善他们的事务，你不要遵循作恶者的道路。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed (the period) with ten (more): thus was completed the term (of communion) with his Lord, forty nights. And Moses had charged his brother Aaron (before he went up): "Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief." |
| PICKTHALL  | And when We did appoint for Moses thirty nights (of solitude), and added to them ten, and he completed the whole time appointed by his Lord of forty nights; and Moses said unto his brother, Aaron: Take my place among the people. Do right, and follow not the way of mischief-makers. |
|   SHAKIR   | And We appointed with Musa a time of thirty nights and completed them with ten (more), so the appointed time of his Lord was complete forty nights, and Musa said to his brother Haroun: Take my place among my people, and act well and do not follow the way of the mischief-makers. |
