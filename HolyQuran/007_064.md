|    马坚    | 但他们否认他，故我拯救他，和与他同船的人，并使那些否认我的迹象者统统淹死。他们确是盲目的民众。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | But they rejected him, and We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark: but We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our signs. They were indeed a blind people! |
| PICKTHALL  | But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and We drowned those who denied Our tokens. Lo! they were blind folk. |
|   SHAKIR   | But they called him a liar, so We delivered him and those with him in the ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our communications; surely they were a blind people. |
