| 马坚       | 你当向信道而行善的人报喜；他们将享有许多下临诸河的乐园，每当他们得以园里的一种水果为给养的时候，他们都说：这是我们以前所受赐的。其实，他们所受赐的是类似的。他们在乐园里将享有纯洁的配偶，他们将永居其中。 |
| YUSUFALI   | But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that their portion is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: "Why, this is what we were fed with before," for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein (for ever). |
| PICKTHAL   | And give glad tidings (O Muhammad) unto those who believe and do good works; that theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; as often as they are regaled with food of the fruit thereof, they say: this is what was given us aforetime; and it is given to them in resemblance. There for them are pure companions; there for ever they abide. |
| SHAKIR     | And convey good news to those who believe and do good deeds, that they shall have gardens in which rivers flow; whenever they shall be given a portion of the fruit thereof, they shall say: This is what was given to us before; and they shall be given the like of it, and they shall have pure mates in them, and in them, they shall abide. |
