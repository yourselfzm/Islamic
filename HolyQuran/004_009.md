|    马坚    | 假若自己遗下幼弱的后裔，自己就会为他们而忧愁；这等人，应当也为别人的孤儿而忧虑，应当敬畏真主，应当对临终的病人说正当的话。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Let those (disposing of an estate) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own if they had left a helpless family behind: Let them fear Allah, and speak words of appropriate (comfort). |
| PICKTHALL  | And let those fear (in their behaviour toward orphans) who if they left behind them weak offspring would be afraid for them. So let them mind their duty to Allah, and speak justly. |
|   SHAKIR   | And let those fear who, should they leave behind them weakly offspring, would fear on their account, so let them be careful of (their duty to) Allah, and let them speak right words. |
