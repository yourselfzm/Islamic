|    马坚    | 我要翻转他们的心和眼，使他们和初次未信一样，我将任随他们彷徨在过分之中。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | We (too) shall turn to (confusion) their hearts and their eyes even as they refused to believe in the first instance: We shall leave them in their trespasses to wander in distraction. |
| PICKTHALL  | We confound their hearts and their eyes. As they believed not therein at the first, We let them wander blindly on in their contumacy. |
|   SHAKIR   | And We will turn their hearts and their sights, even as they did not believe in it the first time, and We will leave them in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on. |
