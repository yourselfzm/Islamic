|    马坚    | 我派遣使者，只为要人奉真主的命令而服从他。他们自欺的时候，假若他们来见你，而且向真主求饶，使者也替他们求饶，那末，他们必发现真主是至宥的，是至慈的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | We sent not a messenger, but to be obeyed, in accordance with the leave of Allah. If they had only, when they were unjust to themselves, come unto thee and asked Allah's forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah indeed Oft-returning, Most Merciful. |
| PICKTHALL  | We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by Allah's leave. And if, when they had wronged themselves, they had but come unto thee and asked forgiveness of Allah, and asked forgiveness of the messenger, they would have found Allah Forgiving, Merciful. |
|   SHAKIR   | And We did not send any apostle but that he should be obeyed by Allah's permission; and had they, when they were unjust to themselves, come to you and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Apostle had (also) asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Oft-returning (to mercy), Merciful. |
