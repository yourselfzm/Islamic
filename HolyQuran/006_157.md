#أَوْ تَقُولُوا لَوْ أَنَّا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْكِتَابُ لَكُنَّا أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمْ ۚ فَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ ۚ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا ۗ سَنَجْزِي الَّذِينَ يَصْدِفُونَ

|    马坚    | 或者说：“假若天经被降示于我们，那末，我们必定比他们更能遵循正道。”从你们的主发出的明证、正道和慈恩，确已降临你们了。否认真主的迹象，而加以背弃的人，有谁比他还不义呢？背弃我的迹象的人，我将因他们的背弃而以最严厉的刑罚报酬他们。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Or lest ye should say: "If the Book had only been sent down to us we should have followed its guidance better than they." Now then hath come unto you a Clear (sign) from your Lord and a guide and a mercy: then who could do more wrong than one who rejecteth Allah's signs and turneth away therefrom? In good time shall We requite those who turn away from Our Signs with a dreadful penalty for their turning away. |
| PICKTHALL  | Or lest ye should say: If the Scripture had been revealed unto us, we surely had been better guided than are they. Now hath there come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, a guidance and mercy; and who doeth greater wrong than he who denieth the revelations of Allah, and turneth away from them ? We award unto those who turn away from Our revelations an evil doom because of their aversion. |
|   SHAKIR   | Or lest you should say: If the Book had been revealed to us, we would certainly have been better guided than they, so indeed there has come to you clear proof from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who then is more unjust than he who rejects Allah's communications and turns away from them? We will reward those who turn away from Our communications with an evil chastisement because they turned away. |
