|    马坚    | 真主为你们的子女而命令你们。一个男子，得两个女子的分子。如果亡人有两个以上的女子，那末，她们共得遗产的三分之二；如果只有一个女子，那末，她得二分之一。如果亡人有子女，那末，亡人的父母各得遗产的六分之一。如果他没有子女，那末，只有父母承受遗产，那末，他的母亲得三分之一。如果他有几个兄弟姐妹，那末，他母亲得六分之一。（这种分配），须在亡人所嘱的遗赠或清偿亡人所欠的债务之后。——你们的父母和子女，谁对于你们是更有裨益的，你们不知道——这是从真主降示的定制。真主确是全知的，确是至睿的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Allah (thus) directs you as regards your children's (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers (or sisters) the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by Allah: and Allah is All-Knowing, All-wise. |
| PICKTHALL  | Allah chargeth you concerning (the provision for) your children: to the male the equivalent of the portion of two females, and if there be women more than two, then theirs is two-thirds of the inheritance, and if there be one (only) then the half. And to each of his parents a sixth of the inheritance, if he have a son; and if he have no son and his parents are his heirs, then to his mother appertaineth the third; and if he have brethren, then to his mother appertaineth the sixth, after any legacy he may have bequeathed, or debt (hath been paid). Your parents and your children: Ye know not which of them is nearer unto you in usefulness. It is an injunction from Allah. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise. |
|   SHAKIR   | Allah enjoins you concerning your children: The male shall have the equal of the portion of two females; then if they are more than two females, they shall have two-thirds of what the deceased has left, and if there is one, she shall have the half; and as for his parents, each of them shall have the sixth of what he has left if he has a child, but if he has no child and (only) his two parents inherit him, then his mother shall have the third; but if he has brothers, then his mother shall have the sixth after (the payment of) a bequest he may have bequeathed or a debt; your parents and your children, you know not which of them is the nearer to you in usefulness; this is an ordinance from Allah: Surely Allah is Knowing, Wise. |
