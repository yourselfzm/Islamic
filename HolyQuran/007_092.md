|    马坚    | 否认舒阿卜的人，好像没有在那个城市里居住过一样。否认舒阿卜的人，确是亏折的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | The men who reject Shu'aib became as if they had never been in the homes where they had flourished: the men who rejected Shu'aib - it was they who were ruined! |
| PICKTHALL  | Those who denied Shu'eyb became as though they had not dwelt there. Those who denied Shu'eyb, they were the losers. |
|   SHAKIR   | Those who called Shu'aib a liar were as though they had never dwelt therein; those who called Shu'aib a liar, they were the losers. |
