|    马坚    | 不信道的人，假如大地上的一切都归他们所有，再加上同样的一份，而用全部财产去赎取复活日的刑罚；那末，他们的赎金不蒙接受，他们将受痛苦的刑罚。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | As to those who reject faith if they had everything on earth and twice repeated to give as ransom for the penalty of the Day of Judgment it would never be accepted of them. Theirs would be a grievous penalty. |
| PICKTHALL  | As for those who disbelieve, lo! if all that is in the earth were theirs, and as much again therewith, to ransom them from the doom on the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them. Theirs will be a painful doom. |
|   SHAKIR   | Surely (as for) those who disbelieve, even if they had what is in the earth, all of it, and the like of it with it, that they might ransom themselves with it from the punishment of the day of resurrection, it shall not be accepted from them, and they shall have a painful punishment. |
