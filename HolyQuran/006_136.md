#وَجَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالْأَنْعَامِ نَصِيبًا فَقَالُوا هَٰذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَٰذَا لِشُرَكَائِنَا ۖ فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَائِهِمْ فَلَا يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَىٰ شُرَكَائِهِمْ ۗ سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ

|    马坚    | 他们把真主所创造的农产和牲畜，一份供献真主，（一份供献偶像），他们妄言：这是真主的，这是我们的配主的。供献他们的配主的，不能拨归真主；供献真主的，却可以拨归他们的配主。他们的决定真恶劣！ |
|  YUSUFALI  | Out of what Allah hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle they assigned Him a share: they say according to their fancies: "This is for Allah and this for our 'partners'"! But the share of their 'partners' reacheth not Allah whilst the share of Allah reacheth their 'partners'! Evil (and unjust) is their assignment! |
| PICKTHALL  | They assign unto Allah, of the crops and cattle which He created, a portion, and they say: "This is Allah's" - in their make-believe - "and this is for (His) partners in regard to us." Thus that which (they assign) unto His partners in them reacheth not Allah and that which (they assign) unto Allah goeth to their (so-called) partners. Evil is their ordinance. |
|   SHAKIR   | And they set apart a portion for Allah out of what He has created of tilth and cattle, and say: This is for Allah-- so they assert-- and this for our associates; then what is for their associates, it reaches not to Allah, and whatever is (set apart) for Allah, it reaches to their associates; evil is that which they judge. |
