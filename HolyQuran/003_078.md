|    马坚    | 他们中确有一部分人，篡改天经，以便你们把曾经篡改的当做天经，其实，那不是天经。他们说：这是从真主那里降示的。其实那不是从真主那里降示的，他们明知故犯地假借真主的名义而造遥。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | There is among them a section who distort the Book with their tongues: (As they read) you would think it is a part of the Book, but it is no part of the Book; and they say, "That is from Allah," but it is not from Allah: It is they who tell a lie against Allah, and (well) they know it! |
| PICKTHALL  | And lo! there is a party of them who distort the Scripture with their tongues, that ye may think that what they say is from the Scripture, when it is not from the Scripture. And they say: It is from Allah, when it is not from Allah; and they speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly. |
|   SHAKIR   | Most surely there is a party amongst those who distort the Book with their tongue that you may consider it to be (a part) of the Book, and they say, It is from Allah, while it is not from Allah, and they tell a lie against Allah whilst they know. |
