#وَلَئِنْ أَصَابَكُمْ فَضْلٌ مِنَ اللَّهِ لَيَقُولَنَّ كَأَنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُ مَوَدَّةٌ يَا لَيْتَنِي كُنْتُ مَعَهُمْ فَأَفُوزَ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا 

##Walain asabakum fadlun mina Allahi layaqoolanna kaan lam takun baynakum wabaynahu mawaddatun ya laytanee kuntu maAAahum faafooza fawzan AAatheeman

|    马坚    | 如果从真主发出的恩惠降临你们，他必定说：--在他们与他之间好象没有一点友谊一样但愿我曾与他们同在前方，而获得伟大的成功。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | But if good fortune comes to you from Allah, they would be sure to say - as if there had never been ties of affection between you and them - "Oh! I wish I had been with them; a fine thing should I then have made of it!" |
| PICKTHALL  | And if a bounty from Allah befell you, he would surely cry, as if there had been no love between you and him: Oh, would that I had been with them, then should I have achieved a great success! |
|   SHAKIR   | And if grace from Allah come to you, he would certainly cry out, as if there had not been any friendship between you and him: Would that I had been with them, then I should have attained a mighty good fortune. |
