#مَا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِنْ نَفْسِكَ ۚ وَأَرْسَلْنَاكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولًا ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ شَهِيدًا 

##Ma asabaka min hasanatin famina Allahi wama asabaka min sayyiatin famin nafsika waarsalnaka lilnnasi rasoolan wakafa biAllahi shaheedan
