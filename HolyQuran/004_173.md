|    马坚    | 至于信道而且行善的人，他要使他们享受完全的报酬， 并且把他的恩惠加赐他们。至于拒绝为仆，而且妄自尊大者，他要以痛苦的刑罚惩治他们。除真主外，他们不能为自己获得任何保护者，也不能获得任何援助者。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | But to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, He will give their (due) rewards,- and more, out of His bounty: But those who are disdainful and arrogant, He will punish with a grievous chastisement; Nor will they find, besides Allah, any to protect or help them. |
| PICKTHALL  | Then, as for those who believed and did good works, unto them will He pay their wages in full, adding unto them of His bounty; and as for those who were scornful and proud, them will He punish with a painful doom. And they will not find for them, against Allah, any protecting friend or helper. |
|   SHAKIR   | Then as for those who believe and do good, He will pay them fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace; and as for those who disdain and are proud, He will chastise them with a painful chastisement. And they shall not find for themselves besides Allah a guardian or a helper |
