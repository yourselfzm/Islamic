|    马坚    | 麦尔彦之子麦西哈，只是一个使者，在他之前，有许多使者确已逝去了。他母亲是一个诚实的人。他们俩也是吃饭的。你看我怎样为他们阐明一切迹象，然后，你看他们是如何悖谬的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Christ the son of Mary was no more than an Apostle; many were the Apostles that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They had both to eat their (daily) food. See how Allah doth makes His Signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth! |
| PICKTHALL  | The Messiah, son of Mary, was no other than a messenger, messengers (the like of whom) had passed away before him. And his mother was a saintly woman. And they both used to eat (earthly) food. See how We make the revelations clear for them, and see how they are turned away! |
|   SHAKIR   | The Messiah, son of Marium is but an apostle; apostles before him have indeed passed away; and his mother was a truthful woman; they both used to eat food. See how We make the communications clear to them, then behold, how they are turned away. |
