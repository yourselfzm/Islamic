|    马坚    | 假借真主的名义而造谣，或否认其迹象者，有谁比他们还不义呢？这等人将遭遇天经中为他们预定的命运，直到我的众使者来使他们死亡的时候，将对他们说：你们从前舍真主而祈祷的（偶像），现在哪里呢？他们将说：他们已回避我们了。他们将要承认自己原是不信道者。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Signs? For such, their portion appointed must reach them from the Book (of decrees): until, when our messengers (of death) arrive and take their souls, they say: "Where are the things that ye used to invoke besides Allah?" They will reply, "They have left us in the lurch," And they will bear witness against themselves, that they had rejected Allah. |
| PICKTHALL  | Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah or denieth Our tokens. (For such) their appointed portion of the Book (of destiny) reacheth them till, when Our messengers come to gather them, they say: Where (now) is that to which ye cried beside Allah? They say: They have departed from us. And they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers. |
|   SHAKIR   | Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or rejects His communications? (As for) those, their portion of the Book shall reach them, until when Our messengers come to them causing them to die, they shall say: Where is that which you used to call upon besides Allah? They would say: They are gone away from us; and they shall bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers |
