|    马坚    | 他们不肯参加战斗，却对自己的教胞说：假若他们顺从我们，他们不会阵亡。你说：你们为自身抵御死亡吧，如果你们是诚实的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | (They are) the ones that say, (of their brethren slain), while they themselves sit (at ease): "If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves, if ye speak the truth." |
| PICKTHALL  | Those who, while they sat at home, said of their brethren (who were fighting for the cause of Allah): If they had been guided by us they would not have been slain. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Then avert death from yourselves if ye are truthful. |
|   SHAKIR   | Those who said of their brethren whilst they (themselves) held back: Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed. Say: Then avert death from yourselves if you speak the truth. |
