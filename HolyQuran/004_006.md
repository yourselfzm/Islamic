|    马坚    | 你们当试验孤儿，直到他们达到适婚年龄；当你们看见他们能处理财产的时候，应当把他们的财产交还他们；不要在他们还没有长大的时候，赶快浪费地消耗他们的财产。富裕的监护人，应当廉洁自持；贫穷的监护人，可以取合理的生活费。 你们把他们的财产交还他们的时候，应当请人作见证。真主足为监察者。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye find sound judgment in them, release their property to them; but consume it not wastefully, nor in haste against their growing up. If the guardian is well-off, let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable. When ye release their property to them, take witnesses in their presence: But all-sufficient is Allah in taking account. |
| PICKTHALL  | Prove orphans till they reach the marriageable age; then, if ye find them of sound judgment, deliver over unto them their fortune; and devour it not by squandering and in haste lest they should grow up Whoso (of the guardians) is rich, let him abstain generously (from taking of the property of orphans); and whoso is poor let him take thereof in reason (for his guardianship). And when ye deliver up their fortune unto orphans, have (the transaction) witnessed in their presence. Allah sufficeth as a Reckoner. |
|   SHAKIR   | And test the orphans until they attain puberty; then if you find in them maturity of intellect, make over to them their property, and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily, lest they attain to full age; and whoever is rich, let him abstain altogether, and whoever is poor, let him eat reasonably; then when you make over to them their property, call witnesses in their presence; and Allah is enough as a Reckoner. |
