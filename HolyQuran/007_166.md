|    马坚    | 当他们妄自尊大，不肯遵守戒律的时候，我对他们说：你们变成卑贱的猿猴吧！ |
|  YUSUFALI  | When in their insolence they transgressed (all) prohibitions, We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and rejected." |
| PICKTHALL  | So when they took pride in that which they had been forbidden, We said unto them: Be ye apes despised and loathed! |
|   SHAKIR   | Therefore when they revoltingly persisted in what they had been forbidden, We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised and hated. |
