|    马坚    | 有许多先知，曾有些明哲和他们一同作战，那些明哲没有为在主道上所遭遇的艰难而灰心，懈怠，屈服。真主是喜爱坚忍者的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | How many of the prophets fought (in Allah's way), and with them (fought) Large bands of godly men? but they never lost heart if they met with disaster in Allah's way, nor did they weaken (in will) nor give in. And Allah Loves those who are firm and steadfast. |
| PICKTHALL  | And with how many a prophet have there been a number of devoted men who fought (beside him). They quailed not for aught that befell them in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor were they brought low. Allah loveth the steadfast. |
|   SHAKIR   | And how many a prophet has fought with whom were many worshippers of the Lord; so they did not become weak-hearted on account of what befell them in Allah's way, nor did they weaken, nor did they abase themselves; and Allah loves the patient. |
