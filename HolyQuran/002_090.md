| 马坚       | 他们因真主把他的恩惠降给他所意欲的仆人，故他们心怀嫉妒，因而不信真主所降示的经典；他们为此而出卖自己，他们所得的代价真恶劣。故他们应受加倍的谴怒。不信道者，将受凌辱的刑罚。 |
| YUSUFALI   | Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, in that they deny (the revelation) which Allah has sent down, in insolent envy that Allah of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases: Thus have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath. And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith. |
| PICKTHAL   | Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should disbelieve in that which Allah hath revealed, grudging that Allah should reveal of His bounty unto whom He will of His slaves. They have incurred anger upon anger. For disbelievers is a shameful doom. |
| SHAKIR     | Evil is that for which they have sold their souls-- that they should deny what Allah has revealed, out of envy that Allah should send down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath, and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers. |
