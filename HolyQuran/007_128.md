|    马坚    | 穆萨对他的宗族说：你们要求助于真主，要忍受虐待；大地确是真主的，他使他意欲的臣仆继承它；优美的结局只归敬畏者。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Said Moses to his people: "Pray for help from Allah, and (wait) in patience and constancy: for the earth is Allah's, to give as a heritage to such of His servants as He pleaseth; and the end is (best) for the righteous. |
| PICKTHALL  | And Moses said unto his people: Seek help in Allah and endure. Lo! the earth is Allah's. He giveth it for an inheritance to whom He will. And lo! the sequel is for those who keep their duty (unto Him). |
|   SHAKIR   | Musa said to his people: Ask help from Allah and be patient; surely the land is Allah's; He causes such of His servants to inherit it as He pleases, and the end is for those who guard (against evil). |
