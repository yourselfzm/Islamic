|    马坚    | 他的宗族唯一的答覆是说：你们把他们逐出城外，因为他们确是纯洁的民众！ |
|  YUSUFALI  | And his people gave no answer but this: they said, "Drive them out of your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!" |
| PICKTHALL  | And the answer of his people was only that they said (one to another): Turn them out of your township. They are folk, forsooth, who keep pure. |
|   SHAKIR   | And the answer of his people was no other than that they said: Turn them out of your town, surely they are a people who seek to purify (themselves). |
