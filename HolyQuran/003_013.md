|    马坚    | 你们确已得到一种迹象，在交战的两军之中；一军是为主道而战的，一军是不信道的，眼见这一军有自己的两倍。真主以他自己的佑助扶助他所意欲的人。对于有眼光的人，此中确有一种鉴戒。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | "There has already been for you a Sign in the two armies that met (in combat): One was fighting in the cause of Allah, the other resisting Allah; these saw with their own eyes Twice their number. But Allah doth support with His aid whom He pleaseth. In this is a warning for such as have eyes to see." |
| PICKTHALL  | There was a token for you in two hosts which met: one army fighting in the way of Allah, and another disbelieving, whom they saw as twice their number, clearly, with their very eyes. Thus Allah strengtheneth with His succour whom He will. Lo! herein verily is a lesson for those who have eyes. |
|   SHAKIR   | Indeed there was a sign for you in the two hosts (which) met together in encounter; one party fighting in the way of Allah and the other unbelieving, whom they saw twice as many as themselves with the sight of the eye and Allah strengthens with His aid whom He pleases; most surely there is a lesson in this for those who have sight. |
