|    马坚    | 你当如实地对他们讲述阿丹的两个儿子的故事。当时，他们俩各献一件供物，这个的供物被接受了，那个的供物未被接受。那个说：我必杀你。这个说：真主只接受敬畏者的供物。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): it was accepted from one but not from the other. Said the latter: "Be sure I will slay thee." "Surely" said the former "Allah doth accept of the sacrifice of those who are righteous. |
| PICKTHALL  | But recite unto them with truth the tale of the two sons of Adam, how they offered each a sacrifice, and it was accepted from the one of them and it was not accepted from the other. (The one) said: I will surely kill thee. (The other) answered: Allah accepteth only from those who ward off (evil). |
|   SHAKIR   | And relate to them the story of the two sons of Adam with truth when they both offered an offering, but it was accepted from one of them and was not accepted from the other. He said: I I will most certainly slay you. (The other) said: Allah only accepts from those who guard (against evil). |
