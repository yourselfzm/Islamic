|    马坚    | 他们问你怎样待遇孤儿，你说：为他们改善他们的事务是更好的。如果你们与他们合伙，那末，（你们应当记取）他们是你们的教胞。真主能辨别破坏的人和改善的人。假若真主意欲，他必使你们烦难。真主确是万能的，确是至睿的。 |
|  YUSUFALI  | (Their bearings) on this life and the Hereafter. They ask thee concerning orphans. Say: "The best thing to do is what is for their good; if ye mix their affairs with yours, they are your brethren; but Allah knows the man who means mischief from the man who means good. And if Allah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties: He is indeed Exalted in Power, Wise." |
| PICKTHALL  | Upon the world and the Hereafter. And they question thee concerning orphans. Say: To improve their lot is best. And if ye mingle your affairs with theirs, then (they are) your brothers. Allah knoweth him who spoileth from him who improveth. Had Allah willed He could have overburdened you. Allah is Mighty, Wise. |
|   SHAKIR   | On this world and the hereafter. And they ask you concerning the orphans Say: To set right for them (their affairs) is good, and if you become co-partners with them, they are your brethren; and Allah knows the mischief-maker and the pacemaker, and if Allah had pleased, He would certainly have caused you to fall into a difficulty; surely Allah is Mighty, Wise. |
